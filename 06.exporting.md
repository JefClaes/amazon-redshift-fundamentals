# Exporting data

The `COPY` command makes bulk loading data into Redshift trivial. Its counterpart is the `UNLOAD` command. The `UNLOAD` command enables you to export the results of a query to S3. This is useful to export large data sets fast, without having to write too much code.

```SQL
unload ('select * from order_items')
to 's3://webshop-archive-exports/export'
```

The `UNLOAD` operation writes one or more files (or parts) per slice in parallel. By disabling parallelization, you can force Redshift to only write a single file. Files have a maximum file size of 6.2GB. The file names are postfixed with a slice number and a part number.

| filename               |
| ---------------------- |
| orderitems0000_part_00 |
| orderitems0000_part_01 |
| orderitems0001_part_00 |
| ...                    |
