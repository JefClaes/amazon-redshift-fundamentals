# Multiversion Concurrency Control

There are design decisions Redshift made that will make you always want to opt for bulk operations if possible. Blocks are immutable by design, this means that for each statement you execute on a single row, the database will need to clone a whole 1MB block. Immutable blocks allow Redshift to keep serving consistent reads while writes are happening. This is a technique called Multiversion Concurrency Control, or `MVCC` in short - used by many modern storage engines. So for each write, the modified block will be copied, incrementing its version number, while the old block will be marked for deletion. Even though the old block is marked for deletion, queries in flight can continue to read the block without seeing inconsistent data or having to retry. Queries that are issued after the last write, will query the block with the highest version. Compared to other datawarehouse solutions, this makes that bulk loading data into Redshift is an online solution. You can just write batches of data, without seeing blocked or inconsistent reads.

The `COPY` command supports importing data from a handful of sources: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce) and Amazon DynamoDB.
