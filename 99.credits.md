## Acknowledgements

Thanks to Joe Harris, Redshift Database Engineer at AWS. He was kind enough to reach out on Twitter willing to help. He took the time to do a technical review and provide me with crucial improvements and corrections. I had never expected someone *actually* working on Redshift to help out in a big way like this.

Kristien, my partner, encouraged me to write something a bit longer for a change. She was happy to help when I asked her to review the text for any obvious spelling and grammar mistakes. What a second pair of eyes can do!

Shout out to [Antonios Klimis](https://twitter.com/antoniosklimis) and [Stijn Volders](https://twitter.com/one75) for thoroughly reviewing the text and pointing out things that were hard to understand or missing.
